Setup Guide
***********

In order to install DCE you must follow the tutorial :ref:`build-dce`.

The result of the installation process is the creation of libraries from source of DCE and that of |ns3| and also some tools and sources of an optional Linux kernel if you have also chosen to use the stack of a Linux kernel.
